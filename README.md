In our day-to-day life, we use various gadgets such as television, set-top boxes, air conditioners, home theatre, DVD players, and many other remote-operated devices. Different gadgets means maintaining different remote controls which are not only clumsy but also difficult to manage. Universal remote control simplifies our life because it helps us control any IR devices in our daily life. So in this project we are going to build a single IR-based universal remote which can control all available IR-remote controlled electronic gadgets.
